# Zeal-Discord-Bot
A multipurpose Discord Bot coded in Python using the discord.py library that performs multiple advanced functions from providing weather reports to fetching restaurant information based on their location.

## Zomato API
The fact that Discord is a platform mainly for the gaming community where esports is practiced with passion, makes it clear that a lot of the users are people that may keep travelling around the world to new places for tournaments, event tours, etc.

Zeal rescues in such situations to provide the users with quality information about restaurants around them in the ease of a single command in their discord server.

To achieve this the bot has been integrated with the ZOMATO's rest API service that provides such information which the bot converts and displays to the users in a neat Embed. Once the location and number of results to be displayed is specified the following wonder happens:
